French Language Instruction | Teaching-Focused Academic Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal teaching-focused academic website. It is designed for academic search committees, language program directors, colleagues, and students seeking a clear and concrete view of how I teach French—day to day, semester to semester, and across levels.

I am a French language instructor with a PhD in French & Francophone Studies and extensive experience teaching undergraduate French. My professional identity is grounded first and foremost in teaching: building strong language programs, supporting student success, and helping students discover that they *can*, in fact, speak French.

(Yes—even the ones who are convinced they can’t.)

## Teaching Philosophy

I approach French language teaching as a structured, communicative, and student-centered practice. Language learning is not simply the accumulation of vocabulary and rules; it is the gradual development of confidence, fluency, and cultural awareness through meaningful use.

In my classrooms, students speak, listen, read, and write from the very beginning. They negotiate meaning, ask real questions, and occasionally realize—mid-sentence—that they just said something complicated *in French*. Those moments matter.

My courses are carefully scaffolded and highly organized, but they are also active and interactive. Students know what is expected of them and why, and they are encouraged to take linguistic risks in a supportive environment. My goal is to help students see themselves not as “language students,” but as emerging language users.

## Assessment of Speaking and Writing

I assess speaking and writing through transparent, criteria-based rubrics that separate different dimensions of performance, including comprehensibility, accuracy, range, and fluency. This makes expectations clear and grading fair—especially in skills that can otherwise feel subjective.

For speaking, I use a variety of formats: prepared presentations, role-plays, and spontaneous speaking tasks. Students therefore have multiple opportunities to show what they can do, not just one high-pressure moment.

For writing, I use staged assignments with drafts and feedback checkpoints. Students revise before receiving a final grade, reinforcing the idea that writing is a process rather than a one-shot performance. My feedback is always specific and actionable—students should leave knowing not only *what* to improve, but *how* to do it.

Assessment, in my view, should support learning—not end the conversation.

## Curriculum Design and Sequencing Across Levels

I think about curriculum sequencing as building a coherent progression in which each level prepares students for the next. Students should never feel as though they are starting from zero every semester.

In beginning courses (101–102), I focus on high-frequency communicative functions—introducing oneself, describing people and situations, asking and answering questions—while building confidence through structured repetition.

At the intermediate level (201–202), students are expected to handle more spontaneous conversation and narration. The structure remains, but flexibility increases.

At upper levels, the emphasis shifts toward critical thinking in the target language: analyzing texts, interpreting cultural materials, and articulating arguments in French.

I use backward design throughout the curriculum. If the goal is study abroad success or advanced coursework, then each level should quietly—but deliberately—prepare students to get there.

## Inclusive and Global Francophone Pedagogy

I approach diversity, equity, and inclusion through two guiding principles: representation and access.

Representation means teaching French as a global language, not a single national narrative. My courses include materials from across the Francophone world—Senegal, Haiti, Martinique, Quebec—so students encounter linguistic and cultural plurality early on.

Access means designing courses so that all students can succeed, regardless of background or prior language experience. I use clear expectations, scaffolded tasks, and participation structures that prevent a small number of confident speakers from dominating.

I am especially attentive to students who arrive convinced that “languages just aren’t their thing.” Helping students unlearn that belief is often one of the most meaningful parts of the job.

## Classroom Climate and Student Support

I work intentionally to create a classroom climate that is respectful, transparent, and supportive. When challenges arise—such as grade disputes—I begin by listening carefully. Students want to understand how they are being evaluated and how they can improve.

I rely on consistent rubrics and concrete examples to address concerns fairly. This approach not only resolves conflict, but often turns frustration into motivation.

When sensitive cultural moments arise in class, I address them directly but constructively. I aim to interrupt reductive ideas without shaming students, using these moments to model critical thinking, nuance, and respectful dialogue. Mistakes are part of learning—how we respond to them matters.

## Thoughtful Use of Technology

I use educational technology strategically, always in service of learning goals. I share audio models and resources through the LMS so students can review outside of class, and I use tools such as Flipgrid for asynchronous speaking practice when appropriate.

I also incorporate platforms like Quizlet or Kahoot for vocabulary review and low-stakes games—because repetition works better when students are a little bit competitive.

That said, technology never replaces interaction. My priority remains live, spontaneous communication in class. Even online or hybrid formats are designed around structured conversation and human connection.

## Advising, Retention, and Student Pathways

I see advising as a natural extension of teaching. Students persist in language study when they feel seen, guided, and connected to a purpose.

I help students identify pathways—study abroad, internships, careers, graduate study—and understand how French can fit into their academic and professional lives. I also try to catch students early when they are struggling or doubting themselves.

Often, a single conversation can shift a student from “I think I’m dropping” to “I’ll try one more semester.” Retention, for me, is not just recruitment; it is relationship-building and helping students recognize their own potential.

## Purpose of This Website

This website is intentionally teaching-focused. It complements my curriculum vitae by presenting a clear, practice-oriented account of how I teach French, design curricula, assess learning, and support students.

It is intended for use in academic hiring processes, interviews, teaching demonstrations, and professional exchange.
