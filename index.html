  <h1>Katayoun Matloubi, PhD</h1>
  <h2>French Language Instruction</h2>

  <p>
    I am a French language instructor with a PhD in French & Francophone Studies.
    I design communicative, student-centered courses that help students build
    confidence, fluency, and cultural awareness across levels.
  </p>

  <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    In my courses, students speak, listen, read, and write from the first day.
    I build structured, interactive classrooms where students use French
    for real communication rather than isolated drills.
  </p>

  <h3>Assessment</h3>
  <p>
    I use transparent rubrics to assess speaking and writing fairly, focusing on
    comprehensibility, accuracy, range, and fluency. Feedback is specific and
    actionable so students know how to improve.
  </p>

  <h3>Curriculum Design</h3>
  <p>
    I design courses as part of a coherent sequence in which each level prepares
    students for the next, using backward design to support long-term success.
